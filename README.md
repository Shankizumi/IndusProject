
Welcome to My Indus Form Submission Project!

What's This All About?

Hey there, welcome to my humble project space! Here, I've put together a simple yet powerful web application that lets you effortlessly submit your details using a neat little form. No frills, just a straightforward way to get your information across.

What Can You Expect?

User-Friendly Interface: You'll find a clean and intuitive interface that makes filling out the form a breeze.

Smart Validation: Don't you hate it when you forget to fill in a required field? Yeah, me too. That's why I've included some nifty client-side validation to make sure you don't miss a beat.

Behind the Scenes Magic: Ever wondered what happens after you hit that submit button? Fear not! My trusty server-side handler is here to save the day. It'll validate your data, give it a thumbs up, and tuck it away safely for future reference.

Celebrate Success: Who doesn't love a pat on the back? After your form is successfully submitted, you'll receive a friendly confirmation message to let you know everything went smoothly.

Take a Peek: Curious to see who else has shared their details? You can take a sneak peek at all the submitted entries whenever you like.

What's Under the Hood?

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js
Storage Solution: A trusty in-memory storage system keeps all your valuable data safe and sound.

Let's Get Started!

Fire Up the Server: node backend/server.js
Launch the Application: Open your favorite web browser and head to http://localhost:3000
